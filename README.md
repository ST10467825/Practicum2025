### Q: Why can I only add 4 songs?

### Q: Where is the data stored?
A: The app uses in-memory storage (parallel arrays) during runtime. Data is not persisted between app restarts.

### Q: How do I clear the playlist? 
A: Currently, you need to restart the app to clear the playlist. Future versions may include a clear button.

Some of the code to add songs to the playlist
Firstly, the code checks to see if there is even any input from the user and puts out an error toast if it is empty.
Once that check is complete, then it proceedes with accepting input and handling it, adding user input into the arrays and handling potential error.s

Some of the code for displaying the playlist
Here, the code first checks if the global arrays where the content would be is empty, if empty, displays toast, if not, populates what is in them.
From there, the average rating can be calculated and displayed
